- 👋 Hi, I’m @FUHAIZ
- 👀 I’m interested in everything including chemical science, materials science and engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning polymer physics because I am a PhD student in KAUST. It's my research area.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everyone who is interested in my job or myself.
- 📫 Please contact me by fuhai.zhou@kaust.edu.sa or mr.fuhaizhou@gmail.com or 2644252432@qq.com if you want. I would like to talk with you and learn something new. Thank you very much.
